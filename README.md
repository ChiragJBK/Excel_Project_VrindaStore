# Excel_Project_VrindaStore
This is my first EXCEL basic project.
In this EXCEL Project, we used a public dataset of a store named VRINDA STORE. 
I solved several basic problems it analyzed as yearly sales data over problems like: ORDERS VS SALES, MEN VS WOMEN SALES, ORDER STATUS, TOP 5 STATES, AGE VS GENDER and ORDER VS GENDER. 
At last, I wrapped this project with an interactive dashboard with the help of PIVOT TABLES AND PIVOT CHARTS. 
When you click my project file it will say View raw
(Sorry about that, but we canâ€™t show files that are this big right now.) something like this. 
Just simply click view raw then it download the file. 
EVERY SHEET OF THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN SHARED THANK YOU.
