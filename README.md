# Excel_Project_VrindaStore
This is my first EXCEL basic project.
In this EXCEL Project, we used a public dataset of a store named VRINDA STORE. 
I solved several basic problems it analyzed as yearly sales data over problems like: ORDERS VS SALES, MEN VS WOMEN SALES, ORDER STATUS, TOP 5 STATES, AGE VS GENDER and ORDER VS GENDER. 
At last, I wrapped this project with an interactive dashboard with the help of PIVOT TABLES AND PIVOT CHARTS. 
EVERY SHEET OF THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN SHARED THANK YOU.
